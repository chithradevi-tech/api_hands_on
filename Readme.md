**1. what is Api?**

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other, enabling them to exchange data and functionality.

**2. What is a protocol?**

A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received between two or more devices, systems, or applications.

| Layer (OSI) | Protocol Examples           |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Application | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS |
| Transport   | TCP, UDP, QUIC              |
| Network     | IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP        |
| Data Link   | Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11)    |
| Security    | TLS/SSL, IPSec              |

4️⃣ **Why Protocols Matter**

Without protocols, devices wouldn’t know how to interpret signals or how to respond.

They ensure consistency, security, and efficiency of communication.

5️⃣ **Real-World Analogy**

Two people speaking the same language and agreeing on how a conversation works (say hello, talk, say goodbye) — that’s a protocol. If one speaks English and the other Japanese without a translator, communication fails.

**3. how data is transferred in a network?**

Data is transferred over a network by breaking it into packets. Each packet carries header information (IP addresses, ports, sequence numbers) and payload (the actual data). Packets move through routers and switches following protocols like TCP/IP. At the destination, packets are reassembled and passed up the stack to the application. Security protocols like TLS can encrypt the data so it’s confidential in transit.

**4. Difference between HTTP and HTTPS?**

| Term                                           | Definition                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**         | A protocol for transferring hypertext (web pages, resources) between browsers and web servers in plaintext. |
| **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** | HTTP **over TLS/SSL**, which encrypts the communication between client and server.                          |


| Feature                     | **HTTP**                                                          | **HTTPS**                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security**                | No encryption — data travels in plaintext.                        | Encrypted with **TLS/SSL** — data secured in transit.                             |
| **Port**                    | Default **80**                                                    | Default **443**                                                                   |
| **Certificate Required**    | Not needed                                                        | Needs an **SSL/TLS certificate** issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  |
| **Data Integrity**          | Vulnerable to interception, tampering, man-in-the-middle attacks. | Protects against interception and tampering.                                      |
| **Authentication**          | None by default.                                                  | Server identity verified through the certificate.                                 |
| **SEO / Browser Treatment** | Labeled “Not Secure” by modern browsers.                          | Preferred by browsers; gets SEO ranking benefits.                                 |
| **Performance**             | Slightly faster (no encryption overhead).                         | Modern TLS is very efficient; plus supports HTTP/2/3 which can be faster overall. |

**5. When to use HTTP vs HTTPS?**

**1️⃣ Use HTTP (non-secure) only when:**

No sensitive data is involved (purely public content).
Example: A static test page or an internal dev tool on a private network not exposed externally.

Prototyping or debugging where encryption overhead isn’t needed temporarily.

Very controlled environments (air-gapped or private labs) where both endpoints are trusted.

⚠️ Even in these cases, modern browsers will often warn users “Not Secure.”


**2️⃣ Use HTTPS when:**

Any sensitive or personal data is sent or received (login credentials, payment info, health records).

User authentication is required (logins, sessions, APIs with tokens).

Compliance standards apply (PCI-DSS for credit cards, HIPAA for health data, GDPR for EU privacy).

Public-facing websites — all modern browsers and search engines expect HTTPS.

APIs used by mobile/web apps — to prevent interception and tampering of API calls.

SEO & browser trust — Google ranks HTTPS sites higher and Chrome marks HTTP “Not Secure.”

**6. What is SSL?**

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It’s a cryptographic protocol that encrypts data between client and server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. Although SSL itself is outdated and replaced by TLS, the term is still widely used to refer to the certificates and secure connections we see as HTTPS in browsers


**How SSL/TLS Works (Simplified)**

Handshake:

Browser requests a secure connection.

Server sends its SSL certificate (contains public key).

Browser verifies certificate validity.

Key Exchange:

Client and server agree on session keys for encryption.

Secure Communication:

All data sent between client and server is encrypted using the session key.


| SSL                                       | TLS                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Older, less secure versions (SSL 2.0/3.0) | Modern, more secure (TLS 1.2/1.3) |
| Deprecated, not recommended               | Actively maintained, recommended  |
